                     A single entry visa allows foreign nationals to enter Canada for one-time only. A multiple entry visa allows holders to enter and leave Canada as often as they want as long as the visa is valid. You don’t need to choose which kind to apply for, applicants are automatically considered for multiple entry visas and are only issued single entry visas under unique circumstances.

                <p>
                    Multiple entry visitor visas permit the holder to travel to Canada for six months at a time as many times as they want, as long as the visa remains valid. They can be valid for up to 10 years, but the exact validity period is at the discretion of the visa officer issuing it. If you have some other status document, such as a study permit or a work permit, and are not otherwise visa-exempt, you will automatically be issued a visitor visa allowing you to enter Canada to receive your permit. Usually, this is a multiple entry visa. If you choose to temporarily leave Canada during the course of your studies or temporary work, you will not need to apply for a new visitor visa to re-enter Canada as long as your permit and visa are both still valid.

Student migration is the movement of scholars who study outside their country of birth or citizenship for a period of 12 months or further. During the period of globalization, the internationalisation of advanced education increased dramatically and it has come a request driven exertion. With the rapid-fire rise of transnational education more and more scholars are seeking advanced education in foreign countries and numerous transnational scholars now consider overseas study a stepping- gravestone to endless occupancy within a country. The benefactions that foreign scholars make to host nation husbandry, both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to apply farther enterprise to grease the appearance and integration of overseas scholars, including substantial emendations to immigration and visa programs and procedures. Institutions are contending hard to attract transnational scholars at a time when immigration programs in leading destinations like the US and the UK aren't enabling transition to work visas.
